      <h2>What is CyberSecurity</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems 
        and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as 
        information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are 
        designed to combat threats against networked systems and 
        applications, whether those threats originate from inside or 
        outside of an organization.
