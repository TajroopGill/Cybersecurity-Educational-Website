      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        In January 2023, Mailchimp, a prominent platform for email marketing and newsletters, detected an unauthorized user within their infrastructure. The intruder had previously targeted Mailchimp employees and managed to gain their account credentials through social engineering tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, the malicious actor used the compromised credentials to access data on 133 Mailchimp accounts. Mailchimp claimed that no sensitive information was stolen, but the breach may have disclosed customers' names and email addresses.
